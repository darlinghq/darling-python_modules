# https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/3901
# np.linalg.eig() fails on 1x1 matrices when link against Accelerate.
# Temporary workaround is to avoid linking against Accelerate.
# The bug has been fixed in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/3902
# so this will be unnecessary for releases after 1.8.0rc1
